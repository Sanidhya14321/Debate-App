## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark navy blue (#13294B) to provide contrast and visual depth in a dark theme, creating a sophisticated feel that is not as stark as black. This should feel appropriate for intellectual activity.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) as a vibrant, attention-grabbing hue. In HSL, this hue is similar to the blue requested in the prompt, but with higher saturation and brightness for better contrast against a dark background.
- Accent color: Deep violet (#800080), to add visual interest to key elements while remaining harmoniously aligned with the primary color in the analogous color scheme, while also providing suitable contrast. In HSL this will be similar in hue to the 'indigo' found in the original request.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that offers excellent readability and a modern aesthetic. Chosen for both headers and body copy to maintain a clean, consistent design. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use flat, minimalist icons in a light accent color to represent different scoring categories.
- A clean, modern layout with clear divisions between sections for input, real-time analysis, and results.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user engagement during the debate.
